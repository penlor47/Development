# Development
Repository for the code that I write and practice with
## Folders
### Learning
The Learning folder is where I keep all the files that I've used whilst learing the scripting.

<sub>Please note: There is a .DS_Store file this is simply a file that is required by mac. It is not a file that I've written and I've not deemed it necessary to delete at this present time.<sub>

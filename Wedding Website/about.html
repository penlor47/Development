	  		<h3>Theme:</h3>
			  <h4>Middle Earth</h4>
			  <p><small><i>In case you couldn't tell from the website design.</i></small> Do not worry though, we are not expecting you to dress up as dwarfs, elves, orcs, and other assorted creatures from Middle Earth. This is just an idea of the design that the wedding is going for so that you are not put off. Though we won't frown on anyone that wants to be in costume. It is all part of the fun.</p>
			  <h3>Wedding Registry:</h3>
			  <p>We are grateful for your presence at our wedding and we want to celebrate with all of you. However, we know that some people will want to see a wedding registry so we are putting that in here. We do already have a home, so many traditional registry items we do not need so our registry is not normal. </p>
			  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/wedding/share/matpennywedding" class="map" target="_blank">Link to Our Amazon Wedding Registry</a>
			  <p>Alternatively, we couldn't add personalised gifts to the registry but these are equally lovely. Monetary gifts towards our honeymoon would also be appreciated.</p>
			  <p>Thank you!</p>
